# ![alt text](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=breathecode,32) Contact Managment Application 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router and Flux.

Hello! It is time to start doing professional front-end applications. This time
we will be creating a small contact management application that allows users to:
Create, Update, Delete and Read contacts. [Check it out here!](https://projects.breatheco.de/json?slug=contact-list&preview)

***Please use the Flux architecture for this:*** The Flux architecture is one of the most used proposal for web application architetures.

### How to start?

Clone the repository with the boilerplate, it contains no real functionalities 
but it has 99.99% of the HTML/CSS that you'll need for the project, 
allowing you to focus on the functionality.

### The project is divided in: 

#### Two different views: 

1. Contact: Contains the list of contacts.
2. AddContact: It's just a form that you can use to create or update contatcs.

#### There is one additional component:
ContactCard: Ideal component to display just one contact.

## Expected functionalities

- You have to add the code needed to make your application create, edit, 
and delete contacts from the list.
- (Optional but is a plus) Ask the user for confirmation before deleting, use the 
Modal component for that.

## Steps to install this project

##### 1. Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-contact-list.git
```
##### 2. Install the /node_modules
```
$ npm install
```
##### 3. Run the webpack development server
```
$ npm run c9
```

That is it! Start coding your ReactJS+Flux application.
