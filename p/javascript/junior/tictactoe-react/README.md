## üìù Instructions

Create a tictactoe in React.js just like [this one](https://projects.breatheco.de/json?slug=tictactoe-react&preview). Remember to follow the recommended workflow to start coding:

1. Design your sitemap: How many pages/views?
2. Designing your wireframe: What components and where?
3. Start coding your components only rendering "Hello world" on earch of them (to make sure they work).
4. Create a list of all the possible user and system interactions (events) that occure during runtime (for example: The user clicks on a button to start the game)
6. Create a javascript functions that will handle each of those events.
7. `Console.log` on each of those funtions to make sure they are being called.
9. Continue... whatch the video if you have any other doubts.

### Concepts you wil learn:

- State of the components (global variables)
- Props
- Render method
- The function for checking the winner is a great learning algorithm
