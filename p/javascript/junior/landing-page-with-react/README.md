# ![alt text](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=breathecode,32) Landing page with React 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React.

Ok, time to take it up a notch. Let's build [this landing page](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-heroic-features/) using React Function Components.
The idea is to split Bootstrap components into different function Components, they'll be all imported in the main component Home.jsx

***Please use Function Components for this***

Note: the Cards have different content, think DRY (Don't repeat yourself) and declare only ***one*** component and use ```props``` to handle different content.

### How to start?
